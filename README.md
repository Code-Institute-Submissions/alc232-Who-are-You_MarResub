# Acknowledgements

I would like to thank my mentor [Felipe Alarcon](https://github.com/felipe-alarcon) for the patience and willing to try and help. Also I would like to thank everyone at code institute. Ive really struggled with the understanding of JS portion of the course and they have been patient.

Tutor support have been fantastic in this learning process for me. Giving me great 'nudges' in the right direction and keeping me motivated even when I felt all hope was lost. This will be a continuous journey of learning and one I hope comes a lot easier in the future!
